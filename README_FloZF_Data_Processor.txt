Version 1.0

This program requires Python as well as the packages Pandas and matplotlib.

In order to use the program 'FlowZF Data Processor.ipynb', first save your data from the FloZF software onto the computer that you will be running the program on. 

Next, edit the filename for the data, changing the '.pfl' to '.csv'. Next in the pd.readtable function on line 3, enter the directory pathway to your datafile. 

When processing the data, ensure that your units on the y-axis of the graph are correct (the default for the program is photon counts, and will be different depending on the kind of analysis that you are doing).
